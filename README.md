# trie-system
A Command Line Interface which can interact with a Trie hosted globally on a live server

# Trie

# Installation

Make a clone of the git repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/whyroland/trie-system.git
```

cd into the cloned repository on your computer using your command line of choice

Using npm install all necessary dependencies. This may be performed in either of the following ways:

```bash
npm install inquirer
npm install node-fetch
npm install boxen
npm install chalk
```

or (since all of the dependencies are stored in package.json)

```bash
npm install
```

Note that using the second method respectively may lead to some unnecessary dependencies in terms of the client to be installed

Following that, globally install the Command Line Interface

```bash
npm install -g
```

# Usage

In order to activate the CLI use the following command below

```bash
trie-client
```

The rest is mainly self-explanatory from there. You will be greeted by a menu with a variety of options to choose from to interact with the Trie on the server.
